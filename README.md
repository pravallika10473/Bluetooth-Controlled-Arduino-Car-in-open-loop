# Bluetooth-controlled-Arduino-Car in open loop
This car can be controlled through Bluetooth.
It can go forward ,backward, turn right, turn left with specified speed.
linear equations of speed in forward,backward and angular velocity in turnright,turnleft functions are calibrated for my specific car.
